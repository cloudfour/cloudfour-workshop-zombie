<p>Establish and maintain good web hygiene habits. We've become lazy, our sites bloated and stupid. Those things you could get away with back at the farm will get you killed straightaway in zombie gadget combat. Time to shape up and ship out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initial contacts with zombies are extremely traumatic, causing shock, panic, disbelief and possibly denial, hampering survivors' ability to deal with hostile encounters. -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_apocalypse" title="Wikipedia article on Zombie Apocalypse">Wikipedia</a></p>
